    "Suppose you were tasked creating a system that will classify systems of roads into several categories (city, suburban, country, dirt, etc.), just given their intersections (the nodes) and distance to each intersection (the connection). These graphs are not bounded in any way. Can a road system have 100 roads and 200 connections? What about 1000 roads and 10,000 connections? It is not a well-defined feature set. However, we can use the graph kernel to compare these graphs anyway, even if they are completely different. Using the kernel process, we can create a feature set with length equal to the number of data points, where each feature is the graph kernel of a point in the data set and the current graph. This allows us to transform the data into something that is easier to work with."

    "Words and sentences, just like the graph above, contain an indefinate number of characters. It is possible to create a run-on sentence that goes on virtually forever. We cannot have a feature space with an indefinate number of features. In addition, sentences like, \"I love machine learning!\" and \"Machine learning is great!\" would be represented totally different in a naive approach, where each character is represented as a feature. Since the phrase \"machine learning\" appears in different positions in the sentences, the representation of both in that feature space doesn't encode that similarity at all. Thus, we turn to a kernel function to compare the strings. This allows us to create another feature space similar to above, where each feature is the string kernel applied to a particular point in the data set and the current point."

    "If we have a nonlinear dataset, the polynomial kernel can be very useful. It allows us to transform the data using combinations of the features like $ x_1^2, x_1x_2,etc $. Recall the distance transformation, which can similarly classify nonlinear data. The distance transformation converts each feature to be the distance of that point to another specific point in the training data. Thus, the number of features will be proportional to the number of data points in the training data. However, with a polynomial kernel, the number of features will be proportional to the number of original features (on the order of number-of-features^n, where n is the number of degrees). Thus, we may want to use one or the other depending on if the data set has few features and many data points or many features and few data points. In addition, testing may be needed to find out the best degree of the polynomial classifier. Either way, the transformations allow us to classify nonlinear data."
